# Wordle Game

<p>This is a simple Wordle game which can be played in Command Line. The game is built in Python language. Five letter wordset is taken from NLTK courpus dataset. But I plan to use the NY Times Wordle wordset as the NLTK courpus wordset has words that are not only English but words borrowed from different languages. For instance I encounter Hindi words like Vidya and Besan, which does not have any meaning in English but are borrowed from Hindi language.</p>


In future work I plan to use dictionary API to get synonym or meaning of the word to provide hint to the player. Also, I plan to convert this project into a website.
